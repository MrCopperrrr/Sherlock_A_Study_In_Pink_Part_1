# Programming Fundamentals Assignment 1: Sherlock - A Study in Pink

## 1. Description:

This assignment challenges students to apply fundamental programming concepts in C++ to simulate elements from the first episode of the BBC TV series "Sherlock," titled "A Study in Pink."  Students will implement functions to model Sherlock's deductive abilities and the challenges he faces.

## 2. Objectives:

This assignment reviews and reinforces the use of:

*   Conditional statements
*   Loop statements
*   Arrays (including 2-dimensional arrays)
*   String processing
*   Functions (including function calls and passing parameters by reference)

## 3. Missions:

The assignment consists of several missions:

1.  **The First Encounter:** Simulate Sherlock's initial deductions about Watson.
2.  **Tracing the Luggage:** Implement a function to model Sherlock's luggage searching process, considering different possible roads and probabilities.
3.  **Chase the Taxi:** Simulate Sherlock and Watson's pursuit of the taxi, using a 2D array to represent the city map and calculate scores at each location.
4.  **Valid Password:** Write a function to check the validity of a password based on a set of rules and the victim's email address.
5.  **Find the Correct Password:** Determine the most likely correct password from a list of candidate passwords based on frequency and length.

## 4. Input Data:

Input data is read from a file whose name is passed as a command-line argument. This file contains initial values for health points (HP), experience points (EXP), money (M), and event codes (E) used in the missions. The specific format is described in the assignment specification.
